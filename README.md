# TO_DO-APP
i used MERN stack to make a simple TO_DO app where user can perform crud operation and change background color for dark mode , It is just a beginner friendly project, I will keek on inproving the logics.
there is 2 file missing. I don't upload node_modules folder for both backend and todo_app2. So it has to be done manually if want to impliment the code.
